## Privacy Policy

**New Fake Domain** takes your privacy seriously and is committed to ensuring that your personal information is fully protected.

### 1. **No Data Collection**
We do not collect, store, or share any personal data from users. The app is designed to function entirely offline after downloading the necessary domain data from publicly available sources. Once the domain data is downloaded, all processing happens locally on your device.

### 2. **Permissions**
The app may request access to storage on your device in order to download and store domain data for analysis. This is necessary for the core functionality of the app and is limited to domain information only. No personal or sensitive information is accessed or stored.

### 3. **Third-party Services**
**New Fake Domain** does not use any third-party services that may collect data. The app only retrieves publicly available domain information for analysis purposes and does not share or transmit this data to any external servers.

### 4. **Security**
Since **New Fake Domain** does not collect or store any personal information, there is no risk of sensitive data breaches or misuse. The app operates entirely on the user's device and does not require any form of account creation or login.

### 5. **User Control**
You are in full control of the app's functionality. After downloading domain data, you can use the app offline and choose when and how to search for suspicious domains. All the data used within the app is derived from publicly available sources.

### 6. **Updates to the Privacy Policy**
Any future updates to the privacy policy will be reflected here. However, since the app does not collect user data, changes to this policy are unlikely.
